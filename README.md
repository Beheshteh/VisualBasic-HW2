# The VBA of Wall Street
I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. 

I created a script that will loop through all the stocks and take the following info.

   * Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.

   * The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.

   * The total Volume of the stock

   * Ticker symbol

   * Did conditional formatting that highlighted positive change in green and negative change in red.

   * The solution also is able to locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
